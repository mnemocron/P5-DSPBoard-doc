In HAM radio or hobby music exists a demand for a cheap and simple audio effect box.
The goal of this project is the development of such an effect box with the focus on good performance at low cost using the ARM Cortex-M4 series processor architecture because it offers floating point digital signal processing (DSP).
The device uses an STM32F412 microcontroller with a TLV320 stereo audio codec and features a USB port for power and programming. Additionally the board also features two 1 inch OLED displays, two rotary encoders and two pushbuttons and is capable of running on a rechargeable battery.
The board allows to manipulate the audio signal using the CMSIS/DSP library, where a simple FIR filter is implemented for demonstration purposes.
As a result the hardware has a $THD_2$ of 75.77dB and an ENOB of 11.23 bit.
